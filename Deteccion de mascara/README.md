# Face-Mask-Detection-and-data-logging

Face_Mask_detector.py is the Face Mask detector. It can detect wheather a person is wearing a Face Mask or Not. I have already included the pre-tained model file for the face Mak detection.
Have a look at this video for the Face Mask Detection.

I also wanted to store the data of the person who was not wearing the face Mask for which i needed to Log the data.
For the data logging i have created an another script named "msxlt.py". To better understand the script open and run the "XL_create_test_script.py" i have provided all the required comments there.

For face recognition i have seperately trained a model. You can train your own model and include in the program. Just to see how i programmed the entire script you can have a looh at the 
"FMDlogger.py" file. But this file will not work for you. Use it as a reference file.

I hope you like it...
